Building a product always starts somewhere. For me, it started with a small, recurring frustration that I couldn't shake.

## The Problem I Kept Running Into

I write a lot. Emails, messages, documents, proposals — in multiple languages, in different tones, for different audiences. And every time I needed to polish a sentence or rewrite a paragraph, I found myself jumping between tools, crafting AI prompts from scratch, copying and pasting results, and losing more time than I had planned.

Generic AI tools like ChatGPT are powerful, but they're built for conversations. Every time I wanted to fix grammar or translate an email into formal French, I had to write a prompt explaining what I needed. Over and over again.

I wanted something faster. Something purpose-built.

## The Decision to Build Something

So I asked myself a simple question: what would the ideal text editing tool actually look like?

The answer was equally simple. No prompts. No chatting. Just: paste your text, pick a transformation, get the result. Done.

That's what Stylo became.

## What Stylo Is Built For

Stylo focuses on one thing — transforming text the way you need it:

- **Grammar & spelling** — clean up any text in seconds
- **Tone adjustment** — switch between formal, casual, legal, or fun writing styles
- **Translation** — write in your language, get a polished version in another
- **Reply generation** — respond to emails and messages without starting from scratch
- **Document drafting** — turn plain language into proper formal letters or complaints

Every transformation is one click. No prompt engineering required.

## Why I Keep Building It

The honest answer is that I still use Stylo every day. It saves me real time on real tasks. And based on the feedback I get, other people experience the same thing.

There's something satisfying about building a tool that solves a genuine problem — not a hypothetical one, but one you live with daily. That's the kind of product I want to keep improving.

## What's Next

Stylo is still growing. I'm working on expanding the range of transformations, improving language support, and making the experience even more seamless. The core principle won't change: it should be fast, focused, and effortless to use.

If you've ever lost time wrestling with text instead of just getting your work done, [give Stylo a try](/dashboard). It might be exactly what you've been looking for.
